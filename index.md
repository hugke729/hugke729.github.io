> Assistant Professor (Senior Research) at Oregon State University

My current and past research has spanned from the Antarctic, to the Canadian Arctic, and now Greenland and the tropical Pacific. Across this broad range of settings, I am interested in understanding the physics of smaller-scale processes that ultimately influence larger-scale processes. To achieve this, I combine numerical modelling with analysis of in situ observations.
