# Kenneth Hughes, Physical Oceanographer

> PhD candidate combining modelling with observations to best understand the ocean

I'm a physical oceanographer at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada. My PhD research looks at small-scale ocean processes in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Through a combination of shipboard observations and numerical modelling, I am quantifying and characterising the flow, mixing, and friction within the numerous channels of the Archipelago.
